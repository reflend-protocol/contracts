# Reflend-protocol

The Reflend Protocol is an Ethereum smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the mToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain supply capital (Ether or ERC-20 tokens) to receive mTokens or borrow assets from the protocol (holding other assets as collateral). The Reflend mToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.
